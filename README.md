# Python Coding Challenges

## Organized by data type
The coding challenges are written in Python 3 and are broken down into groups based on the primary data type or data structure they cover. Each coding challenge is stored in its own sub-directory, and has its own README with a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution(s) and a link to a video tutorial.

## No skill levels indicated
None of the coding challenges are designated by a skill level, for several reasons:

* What is easy for one person may be difficult for another
* Skill levels can deter people from trying challenging problems
* Skill levels can hurt your learning process if you give yourself a hard time for not yet knowing what you think you "should" know how to do

## Doctests included
Doctests are included with each coding challenge, for several reasons:

* Testing is an integral part of software development
* As such, you'll want to demonstrate in an interview that you know you need to think about testing; even better if you can write a test
* Doctests are a simple kind of test to write and are great for testing small functions.
* Doctests provide example inputs and outputs to help you code your solution to the challenge

## Complete the challenges on your own
If you want to try to solve these coding challenges on your own, you could copy and paste each one into a new Python file on your computer or IDE. But there's a more efficient way to do this:

### Download all the files using your Terminal (Mac/Linux)

(If you can add the PC info to this section, please read the Contributing Guidelines below and submit a pull request!)

**Super easy GUI ("graphical user interface") version:** Click the green Clone/Download button in the upper right corner of this page. Select "Download ZIP". Once the download is complete, double-click on the .ZIP file (you may need to search for it in your Downloads folder). The Python-Coding-Challenges folder should appear.

**Also-easy step-by-step instructions for cloning in your Terminal:**

1. Open your Terminal. 
- If you don't know what this is or how to find it, press the `COMMAND` key and the `spacebar` key at the same time, and your Spotlight will open up. Type the word "Terminal" into the search bar that appears, and then double-click on the Terminal icon. This will open the Terminal for you. You should drag the Terminal icon to your dock, so you can access it more easily next time.

2. Once in the Terminal, use the command line to navigate to the directory you want the Python-Coding-Challenges folder to be in.
- If you aren't sure how to do this, let's just store it in your Desktop. Navigate to the Desktop directory while in your Terminal by typing in `cd Desktop` and pressing the `RETURN` or `ENTER` key. This means "change directory", and you are supplying the name of the directory you want to switch to.
- You can verify that you are truly in the intended directory by typing the command `pwd` and pressing the `RETURN` or `ENTER` key. This stands for "print working directory". You should see a file path that ends with "Desktop", something like this: `/Users/<your username>/Desktop`.
- Another way you can verify you are truly in the intended directory is by looking at the text that appears on the left side of each new line in the Terminal. Mine looks like this: `MacBook-Air:Desktop allardbrain$`. The general format yours probably has is something like this: `<computer identifier>:Desktop <username>$`.

3. Copy and paste the following code into your Terminal and press `RETURN` or `ENTER`: `git clone https://github.com/allardbrain/Python-Coding-Challenges.git`. A new folder called `Python-Coding-Challenges` will appear in whichever directory you're in (eg: in the Desktop).

4. To verify that the clone worked, you can either minimize your Terminal & browser windows so you can see the new folder on your Desktop (double-click it to open it), or you can run the command `cd Python-Coding-Challenges` then press `RETURN` or `ENTER`. Your Terminal prompt will now look something like this: `MacBook-Air:Python_Coding_Challenges allardbrain$` and if you run `pwd` again, you'll see something like this: `/Users/allardbrain/Desktop/Python_Coding_Challenges`.

### Opening & running the files using your Terminal (Mac/Linux) - continued from above

5. Open up your text editor or IDE. 
- If you aren't sure what a text editor is or whether or not you have one, see Step 1 about opening the Spotlight and search for "TextWrangler", which is pre-installed on newer Macs.
- If you don't have TextWrangler, you can download Sublime for free. Another popular text editor is Atom, which is also available for download.

## Website Coming Soon!
I'm working on a very simple website that will allow you to filter these coding challenges further, to allow for more efficient practice. For example, you'll be able to filter across data types & data structures for:

* Challenges that use loops
* Challenges that use nested loops
* Challenges that use comparisons & conditionals
* Challenges that can be solved with recursion
* Challenges that can be solved with RegEx
* etc.

So, if you wanted more practice with nested loops, you'd be able to access all the challenges that use nested loops whether the primary data type was a dictionary, a list, a string, etc.
