# Python Coding Challenges

## Organized by concept / data type
The coding challenges are written in Python 3 and are broken down into groups based on the concept or data structure they cover. Each coding challenge is stored in its own directory, and has its own README with a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution and a link to a video tutorial.

## No skill levels indicated
None of the coding challenges are designated by a skill level, for several reasons:

* What is easy for one person may be difficult for another
* Skill levels can deter people from trying challenging problems
* Skill levels can hurt your learning process if you give yourself a hard time for not yet knowing what you think you "should" know how to do

## Doctests
Doctests are included with each coding challenge, for several reasons:

* Testing is an integral part of software development
* As such, you'll want to demonstrate in an interview that you know you need to think about testing; even better if you can write a test
* Doctests provide example inputs and outputs to help you code your solution to the challenge

## Cloning this repo
If you want to try to solve these coding challenges on your own, you could copy and paste each one into a new Python file on your computer. But there's a more efficient way to do this:

1. Use the command line to navigate to the directory you want the Python-Coding-Challenges folder to be in (eg: navigate to your Desktop). Run the command `git clone https://github.com/allardbrain/Python-Coding-Challenges.git`.

2. Click the green clone/download button in the upper right hand corner of this webpage, and click on 'Download ZIP'. You'll need to un-zip the folder (on a Mac, you should be able to just double-click on the zip file.) You can then drag and drop the Python-Coding-Challenges folder anywhere you like.
