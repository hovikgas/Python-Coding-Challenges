From the Codecademy Python track.

Define a function called anti_vowel that takes one string, text, 
as input and returns the text with all of the vowels removed.

For example: anti_vowel("Hey You!") should return "Hy Y!".

Don't count Y as a vowel.
Make sure to remove lowercase and uppercase vowels.

    while index < len(text):
        char = text[index]
        if char == "a" or char == "A" or char == "e" or char == "E" or char == "i" or char == "I" or char == "o" or char == "O" or char == "u" or char == "U":
            index += 1
        else: 
            result = result + char
            index += 1
