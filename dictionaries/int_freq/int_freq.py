'''
Write a function called int_frequency() that takes a list of positive integers as
an argument and returns the integer that appears the most frequently in the list.
If there are multiple integers that share the same high frequency, return any one
of the integers. If the list is empty, return None.

>>> int_frequency([])


>>> int_frequency([3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5]) == 3 or 4 or 5
True

>>> int_frequency([1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5])
1
